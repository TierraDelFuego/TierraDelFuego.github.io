<th>Notes:
<tr><td>
It is not known what, if anything, is done with the files that are
automatically uploaded to Valve when a game crashes/asserts. Some
games that are written by one developer and ported by another will
have the files uploaded to the original developer and the developer that
ported the game will not have access to the dump files/data. And the
developer that created the game won't care about the dumps since the
developer that ported the game is responsible for that game.
