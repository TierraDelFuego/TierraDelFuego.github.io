<tr><td>Kodi looks good but it is essentially a reinvention of the wheel, from a round one to a square one.
<tr><td><p>First impression is good because they have put a lot of
effort into making it look good. But once you start to use it you
realize that the problem is that they seem to have a better gui team
than the programming team.  Try to use the file manager. It's not
good. It would not play HD videos over the network or even from a USB
stick. On the same laptop and using a linux distro installed to the
same hard drive I could easily watch the HD video with zero problems.
No stutters, perfect sound, perfectly rendered video. And just using
the distro installed Mplayer.</p>

<tr><td>So how does a project like Kodi manage to miss the mark by so
much?  I don't know.
